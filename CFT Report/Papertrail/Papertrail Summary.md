# **Papertrail CTF — Summary**

**Papertrail** is a cybersecurity investigation challenge where participants analyze Microsoft Defender endpoint logs to uncover a simulated attacker’s activity on an intern workstation. 
The challenge is built around **15 flags**, each representing a different stage of a realistic intrusion.

During the CTF, the attacker runs a PowerShell script, checks for sensitive data, performs reconnaissance on users, sessions, storage, and processes, tests network connectivity, stages data for exfiltration, and sets up persistence through a scheduled task and a registry autorun entry. 
The attacker also leaves behind a misleading shortcut to obscure their actions.

The goal of the Papertrail CTF is to help participants practice threat hunting, improve KQL skills, understand attacker behavior, and learn how to reconstruct an attack timeline from endpoint telemetry. 
It’s designed to be approachable for new analysts while still offering meaningful depth for more experienced investigators.
